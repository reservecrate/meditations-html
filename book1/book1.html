      <h1>Debts and Lessons</h1>
      <h2>1. My grandfather Verus</h2>
      <p>Character and self-control.</p>
      <h2>2. My father (from my own memories and his reputation)</h2>
      <p>Integrity and manliness.</p>
      <h2>3. My mother</h2>
      <p>
        Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to
        do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she
        lived—not in the least like the rich.
      </p>
      <h2>4. My great-grandfather</h2>
      <p>
        To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to
        accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.
      </p>
      <h2>5. My first teacher</h2>
      <p>
        Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that
        in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my
        own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Diognetus</h2>
      <p>
        Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and
        hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all
        the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes
        like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to
        study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write
        dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and
        the cloak.
        <h2>7. Rusticus</h2>
        <p>The recognition that I needed to train and discipline my character.<br>
Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to write treatises on
abstract questions, or deliver moralizing little sermons, or compose imaginary
descriptions of The Simple Life or The Man Who Lives Only for Others. To
steer clear of oratory, poetry and belles lettres.<br>
Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things like that. To write
straightforward letters (like the one he sent my mother from Sinuessa). And to
behave in a conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed us want
to make up.<br>
To read attentively—not to be satisfied with “just getting the gist of it.” And
not to fall for every smooth talker.<br>
And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own
copy.</p>
        <h2>8. Appolonius</h2>
        <p>Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attention to nothing, no
matter how fleetingly, except the logos. And to be the same in all circumstances
—intense pain, the loss of a child, chronic illness. And to see clearly, from his
example, that a man can show both strength and flexibility.<br>
His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who clearly viewed his
expertise and ability as a teacher as the humblest of virtues.<br>
And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing your
self-respect or appearing ungrateful.</p>
        <h2>9. Sextus</h2>
        <p>Kindness.<br>
An example of fatherly authority in the home. What it means to live as
nature requires.<br>
Gravity without airs.<br>
To show intuitive sympathy for friends, tolerance to amateurs and sloppy
thinkers. His ability to get along with everyone: sharing his company was the
highest of compliments, and the opportunity an honor for those around him.<br>
To investigate and analyze, with understanding and logic, the principles we
ought to live by.<br>
Not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of passion and yet full of
love.<br> To praise without bombast; to display expertise without pretension.</p>
        <h2>10. The literary critic Alexander</h2>
        <p>Not to be constantly correcting people, and in particular not to jump on them
whenever they make an error of usage or a grammatical mistake or
mispronounce something, but just answer their question or add another example,
or debate the issue itself (not their phrasing), or make some other contribution to
the discussion—and insert the right expression, unobtrusively.</p>
        <h2>11. Fronto</h2>
        <p>To recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power produces, and
the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by people from “good families.”</p>
        <h2>12. Alexander the Platonist</h2>
        <p>Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m too busy, unless
I really am. Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people
around me because of “pressing business.”</p>
        <h2>13. Catulus</h2>
        <p>Not to shrug off a friend’s resentment—even unjustified resentment—but try
to put things right.<br>
To show your teachers ungrudging respect (the Domitius and Athenodotus
story), and your children unfeigned love.</p>
        <h2>14. [My brother] Severus</h2>
        <p>To love my family, truth and justice. It was through him that I encountered
Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion and Brutus, and conceived of a society of equal
laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the
liberty of their subjects above all else.<br>
And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in valuing philosophy.<br>
And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and never to
doubt your friends’ affection for you. And that when people incurred his
disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate
about his attitude to anything: it was always clear.</p>
        <h2>15. Maximus</h2>
        <p>Self-control and resistance to distractions.<br>
Optimism in adversity—especially illness.<br>
A personality in balance: dignity and grace together.<br>
Doing your job without whining.<br>
Other people’s certainty that what he said was what he thought, and what
he did was done without malice.<br>
Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor hesitant—or
bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious—but not aggressive or paranoid
either.<br>
Generosity, charity, honesty.<br>
The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than being kept on it.<br>
That no one could ever have felt patronized by him—or in a position to
patronize him.<br>
A sense of humor.</p>
        <h2>My adopted father</h2>
        <p>Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached them.
Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.</p>
<p>Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.</p>
<p>His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.</p>
<p>A sense of when to push and when to back off.</p>
<p>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.</p>
<p>His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or
to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind
to take care of something always found him the same when he returned.</p>
<p>His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost,
never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely.</p>
<p>His constancy to friends—never getting fed up with them, or playing
favorites.</p>
<p>Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.</p>
<p>And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even
minor things.</p>
<p>His restrictions on acclamations—and all attempts to flatter him.</p>
<p>His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship of the treasury.
His willingness to take responsibility—and blame—for both.</p>
<p>His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no
demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Always sober, always steady, and
never vulgar or a prey to fads.</p>
