        <h2>1. My grandfather Verus</h2>
        <p>Character and self-control.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>2. My father (from my own memories and his reputation)</h2>
        <p>Integrity and manliness.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>3. My mother</h2>
        <p>
          Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to
          do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she
          lived—not in the least like the rich.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>4. My great-grandfather</h2>
        <p>
          To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to
          accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>5. My first teacher</h2>
        <p>
          Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that
          in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my
          own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>6. Diognetus</h2>
        <p>
          Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and
          hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all
          the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes
          like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to
          study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write
          dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and
          the cloak.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>7. Rusticus</h2>
        <p>The recognition that I needed to train and discipline my character.</p>
        <p>
          Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to write treatises on
          abstract questions, or deliver moralizing little sermons, or compose imaginary
          descriptions of The Simple Life or The Man Who Lives Only for Others. To
          steer clear of oratory, poetry and belles lettres.</p>
        <p>
          Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things like that. To write
          straightforward letters (like the one he sent my mother from Sinuessa). And to
          behave in a conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed us want
          to make up.</p>
        <p>
          To read attentively—not to be satisfied with “just getting the gist of it.” And
          not to fall for every smooth talker.</p>
        <p>
          And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own
          copy.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>8. Appolonius</h2>
        <p>Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attention to nothing, no
          matter how fleetingly, except the logos. And to be the same in all circumstances
          —intense pain, the loss of a child, chronic illness. And to see clearly, from his
          example, that a man can show both strength and flexibility.</p>
        <p>
          His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who clearly viewed his
          expertise and ability as a teacher as the humblest of virtues.</p>
        <p>
          And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing your
          self-respect or appearing ungrateful.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>9. Sextus</h2>
        <p>Kindness.</p>
        <p>
          An example of fatherly authority in the home. What it means to live as
          nature requires.</p>
        <p>
          Gravity without airs.</p>
        <p>
          To show intuitive sympathy for friends, tolerance to amateurs and sloppy
          thinkers. His ability to get along with everyone: sharing his company was the
          highest of compliments, and the opportunity an honor for those around him.</p>
        <p>
          To investigate and analyze, with understanding and logic, the principles we
          ought to live by.</p>
        <p>
          Not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of passion and yet full of
          love.</p>
        <p> To praise without bombast; to display expertise without pretension.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>10. The literary critic Alexander</h2>
        <p>Not to be constantly correcting people, and in particular not to jump on them
          whenever they make an error of usage or a grammatical mistake or
          mispronounce something, but just answer their question or add another example,
          or debate the issue itself (not their phrasing), or make some other contribution to
          the discussion—and insert the right expression, unobtrusively.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>11. Fronto</h2>
        <p>To recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power produces, and
          the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by people from “good families.”</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>12. Alexander the Platonist</h2>
        <p>Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m too busy, unless
          I really am. Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people
          around me because of “pressing business.”</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>13. Catulus</h2>
        <p>Not to shrug off a friend’s resentment—even unjustified resentment—but try
          to put things right.</p>
        <p>
          To show your teachers ungrudging respect (the Domitius and Athenodotus
          story), and your children unfeigned love.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>14. [my brother] Severus</h2>
        <p>To love my family, truth and justice. It was through him that I encountered
          Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion and Brutus, and conceived of a society of equal
          laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the
          liberty of their subjects above all else.</p>
        <p>
          And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in valuing philosophy.</p>
        <p>
          And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and never to
          doubt your friends’ affection for you. And that when people incurred his
          disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate
          about his attitude to anything: it was always clear.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>15. Maximus</h2>
        <p>Self-control and resistance to distractions.</p>
        <p>
          Optimism in adversity—especially illness.</p>
        <p>
          A personality in balance: dignity and grace together.</p>
        <p>
          Doing your job without whining.</p>
        <p>
          Other people’s certainty that what he said was what he thought, and what
          he did was done without malice.</p>
        <p>
          Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor hesitant—or
          bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious—but not aggressive or paranoid
          either.</p>
        <p>
          Generosity, charity, honesty.</p>
        <p>
          The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than being kept on it.</p>
        <p>
          That no one could ever have felt patronized by him—or in a position to
          patronize him.</p>
        <p>
          A sense of humor.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>16. My adopted father</h2>
        <p>Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached them.
          Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.</p>
        <p>Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.</p>
        <p>His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.</p>
        <p>A sense of when to push and when to back off.</p>
        <p>Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.</p>
        <p>His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or
          to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind
          to take care of something always found him the same when he returned.</p>
        <p>His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost,
          never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely.</p>
        <p>His constancy to friends—never getting fed up with them, or playing
          favorites.</p>
        <p>Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.</p>
        <p>And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even
          minor things.</p>
        <p>His restrictions on acclamations—and all attempts to flatter him.</p>
        <p>His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship of the treasury.
          His willingness to take responsibility—and blame—for both.</p>
        <p>His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no
          demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Always sober, always steady, and
          never vulgar or a prey to fads.</p>
        <p>The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in
          such abundance—without arrogance and without apology. If they were there, he
          took advantage of them. If not, he didn’t miss them.</p>
        <p>No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him for
          what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified
          to govern both himself and them.</p>
        <p>His respect for people who practiced philosophy—at least, those who were
          sincere about it. But without denigrating the others—or listening to them.</p>
        <p>His ability to feel at ease with people—and put them at their ease, without
          being pushy.</p>
        <p>His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac or
          obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With the result that
          he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or
          ointment.</p>
        <p>This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts—in oratory,
          law, psychology, whatever—and to support them energetically, so that each of
          them could fulfill his potential.</p>
        <p>That he respected tradition without needing to constantly congratulate
          himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values.</p>
        <p>Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but sticking with
          the same old places and the same old things.</p>
        <p>The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to what
          he was doing—fresh and at the top of his game.</p>
        <p>That he had so few secrets—only state secrets, in fact, and not all that many
          of those.</p>
        <p>The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds—games, building
          projects, distributions of money and so on—because he looked to what needed
          doing and not the credit to be gained from doing it.</p>
        <p>No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects, no concern
          for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves. (The robe
          from his farm at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he accepted
          the customs agent’s apology at Tusculum, etc.)</p>
        <p>He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No
          one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with
          due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no
          loose ends.</p>
        <p>You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that he knew how to
          enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and
          all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark
          of a soul in readiness—indomitable.</p>

      <div class="text-paragraph">
        <h2>17. The Gods</h2>
        <p>That I had good grandparents, a good mother and father, a good sister, good
          teachers, good servants, relatives, friends—almost without exception. And that I
          never lost control of myself with any of them, although I had it in me to do that,
          and I might have, easily. But thanks to the gods, I was never put in that position,
          and so escaped the test.</p>
        <p>That I wasn’t raised by my grandfather’s girlfriend for longer than I was.
          That I didn’t lose my virginity too early, and didn’t enter adulthood until it was
          time—put it off, even.</p>
        <p>That I had someone—as a ruler and as a father—who could keep me from
          being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live without a
          troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture—the whole
          charade. That you can behave almost like an ordinary person without seeming
          slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out official obligations.</p>
        <p>That I had the kind of brother I did. One whose character challenged me to
          improve my own. One whose love and affection enriched my life.</p>
        <p>That my children weren’t born stupid or physically deformed.</p>
        <p>That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt
          that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.</p>
        <p>That I conferred on the people who brought me up the honors they seemed to
          want early on, instead of putting them off (since they were still young) with the
          hope that I’d do it later.</p>
        <p>That I knew Apollonius, and Rusticus, and Maximus.</p>
        <p>That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as nature
          requires. The gods did all they could—through their gifts, their help, their
          inspiration—to ensure that I could live as nature demands. And if I’ve failed, it’s
          no one’s fault but mine. Because I didn’t pay attention to what they told me—to
          what they taught me, practically, step by step.</p>
        <p>That my body has held out, especially considering the life I’ve led.</p>
        <p>That I never laid a finger on Benedicta or on Theodotus. And that even later,
          when I was overcome by passion, I recovered from it.</p>
        <p>That even though I was often upset with Rusticus I never did anything I
          would have regretted later.</p>
        <p>That even though she died young, at least my mother spent her last years
          with me.</p>
        <p>That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or
          otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with.
          And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something
          from someone else.</p>
        <p>That I have the wife I do: obedient, loving, humble.</p>
        <p>That my children had competent teachers.</p>
        <p>Remedies granted through dreams—when I was coughing blood, for
          instance, and having fits of dizziness. And the one at Caieta.</p>
        <p>That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the hands of
          charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed
          by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.</p>
        <p>All things for which “we need the help of fortune and the gods.”</p>
